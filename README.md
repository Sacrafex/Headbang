# Headbang
A language designed to make you suffer.

Only 4 symbols allowed: !, &, #, >
Every 4-character chunk represents one character in JS
No newlines. No mercy.

For example,

Javascript: ```console.log("Hi");```

Headbang: ```!!!#!!>#!!>&!&!#!!>#!!#>!!&!&!#>!!#>!!>#!!&#&!&&!>>>!#!&!!#!!>>>&!&#&!>#```

## Why Headbang?
We used to make fun of Java and JavaScript for it's horrible syntax, but here we go, just the perfect language to dislike. Program in this language for a few days and then you will love programming in any other language.

## General Tips
Debugging?, just rewrite it

Adding Features?, just rewrite it

Forget CTRL+C, CTRL+V.
